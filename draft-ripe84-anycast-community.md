--- abstract

This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community for identifying anycast prefixes in IP networks. This well-known advisory transitive BGP community named "ANYCAST" allows an origin Autonomous System (AS) to signal a neighboring network that the tagged IP prefix is available via anycast and should be routed hot potato.

# ANYCAST Community

This document defines the use of a new well-known BGP transitive community, ANYCAST.

The semantics of this community allow a network to interpret the presence of this community as an advisory qualification that this prefix is available via anycast and should be routed in a hot potato fashion.


# Vendor Implementation Recommendations

Vendors MAY provide a shorthand keyword in their configuration language to reference the well-known ANYCAST community attribute value. The suggested string to be used is "anycast".


# Security Considerations

TODO Security


# IANA Considerations

This document requires addition of a new entry to the "BGP Well-known Communities" registry. 
IANA should make include in the registry before publication:

```
ANYCAST (=0xFFFF????)
```
