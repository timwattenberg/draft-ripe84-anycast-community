Abstract

   This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) community for identifying anycast prefixes in IP
   networks.  This well-known advisory transitive BGP community named
   "ANYCAST" allows an origin Autonomous System (AS) to signal a
   neighboring network the tagged IP prefix is available as anycast.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3.  ANYCAST Community

   This document defines the use of a new well-known BGP transitive
   community, ANYCAST.

   The semantics of this community allow a network to interpret the
   presence of this community as an advisory qualification that this
   prefix is available as anycast.

4.  Security Considerations

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires addition of a new entry to the "BGP Well-known
   Communities" registry.  IANA should make include in the registry
